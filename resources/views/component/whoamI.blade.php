             <p>I am a graduate of the prestigious Faculty of Architecture in Timisoara. Furthermore, I chose to follow a Master's Program as well - Tendencies, materials and new technologies in interior architecture - thus transforming my passion for The Art of Living and my keen sense of what Beautiful Visuals represent into a lifetime career.</p>

          <h2 class="ideacat-heading">What I am all about</h2>
             <p>My main specialty is Interior Architecture and Furniture Design, but over the years I have become more and more interested in the World of 3D, thus immersing myself in this complex and special world, to such an extent where I am looked upon as a true CG Artist.</p>
